      <h2>Ideas Sketch</h2>
      <p>
        We initiated our development journey by generating ideas and outlining initial concepts using Miro. Suggestions for map design and game mechanics underwent multiple iterations, culminating in a comprehensive project plan. To bring our ideas to life, we engaged in playthroughs using the initial sketches, enabling us to polish and enhance our concepts iteratively.</p>

          <h2>Core Game Mechanics</h2>
          <p>
            This section delineates the core mechanics of the game, with a focus on the elements I personally contributed to. Our development journey commenced with idea generation and conceptualization using Miro. Suggestions for map design and game mechanics underwent multiple iterations, resulting in a comprehensive project plan. To breathe life into our ideas, we engaged in playthroughs using our initial sketches, allowing us to refine and enhance our concepts iteratively.</p>

        <!-- Feature 1: Nightmare Creatures Puzzle -->
        <div class="feature">
          <h2>Nightmare Creatures Puzzle</h2>
          <h3>Conceptualization:</h3>
          <p>Nightmare creatures are friendly entities within the game world that provide hints and assistance to the player. They exhibit behavior such as following the player's movement and becoming scared when the player gets closer, indicating their timid nature.</p>
